# Nimble Navigator - Application Design

## Overview

Nimble Navigator: A comprehensive digital character sheet application for the Nimble RPG system, built as a web application with offline-first architecture and local storage persistence. The app provides a clean, mobile-responsive interface for managing characters, rolling dice, tracking equipment, and managing combat encounters with full support for temporary HP, saving throws, and equipment management.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** with App Router (client-side only)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **shadcn/ui** component library (built on Radix UI)
- **Zod** for runtime data validation

### Storage
- **Local Storage** with abstraction layer for future server sync
- **No server-side state** currently (designed for easy migration)

## Architecture

### Data Layer

#### Character Model
```typescript
interface Character {
  id: string
  name: string
  level: number
  classId: string
  subclassId?: string
  ancestry: AncestryTrait // Ancestry with features and size category
  background: BackgroundTrait // Background with passive features
  attributes: { strength, dexterity, intelligence, will }
  hitPoints: { current, max, temporary }
  hitDice: { size, current, max }
  wounds: { current, max }
  resources: ResourceInstance[] // Generic resource system (mana, fury, focus, etc.)
  config: CharacterConfiguration
  initiative: Skill
  actionTracker: { current, base, bonus }
  inEncounter: boolean
  skills: { [skillName]: Skill }
  inventory: Inventory
  abilities: Abilities
  grantedFeatures: string[]
  timestamps: { createdAt, updatedAt }
}

// Resource System - Separates pure definitions from runtime state
interface ResourceDefinition {
  id: string
  name: string
  description?: string
  colorScheme: string // Predefined color scheme (blue-magic, red-fury, etc.)
  icon?: string // Icon identifier (sparkles, fire, etc.)
  resetCondition: 'safe_rest' | 'encounter_end' | 'turn_end' | 'never' | 'manual'
  resetType: 'to_max' | 'to_zero' | 'to_default'
  resetValue?: number
  minValue: number
  maxValue: number
}

interface ResourceInstance {
  definition: ResourceDefinition
  current: number
  sortOrder: number
}
```

#### Service Architecture
- **CharacterCreationService** handles character creation with proper initialization and class/ancestry/background features
- **CharacterService** handles character CRUD operations with validation and business logic
- **ClassService** handles class definitions, subclass management, feature progression, and spell tier system
- **AncestryService** manages ancestry definitions, features (stat boosts, proficiencies, darkvision, resistances)
- **BackgroundService** manages background definitions with passive features
- **ContentRepositoryService** unified storage for all custom content (classes, ancestries, backgrounds, abilities, spells)
- **ResourceService** manages generic resource system (mana, fury, focus, etc.) with configurable reset conditions
- **DiceService** manages all dice rolling mechanics with advantage/disadvantage and critical hits
- **ActivityLogService** tracks character actions, dice rolls, and resource usage
- **AbilityService** handles ability usage, cooldowns, and roll calculations
- **SettingsService** manages app settings and character selection
- **Singleton pattern** for direct service access without React Context overhead

#### Storage & State
- **Local Storage** with JSON serialization for persistence
- **Character activity logging** with type-safe log entries
- **App settings** with mode switching (basic/full) and character selection
- **Type-safe** operations with Zod validation

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: Load character and UI state from localStorage via service factory
2. **User Interaction**: Direct service calls update state and trigger persistence
3. **Validation**: Zod schemas validate all data before storage
4. **Storage**: Service layer abstracts localStorage operations
5. **UI Updates**: Service hooks trigger automatic re-renders without Context overhead

## Key Technical Achievements

### Architecture Improvements
- **Eliminated React Context**: Direct service access via singleton pattern
- **ResourceFeature Integration**: Class features automatically grant resources
- **Pure Resource Definitions**: Separated immutable templates from runtime state
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with runtime validation

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Key Attribute Highlighting**: Visual emphasis on class-specific attributes
- **Compact Design**: Space-efficient mobile-first interface
- **Tooltip System**: Icon-only buttons with informative hover tooltips
- **Generic Resource System**: Flexible resource management with color schemes

## Development & Configuration

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run lint     # Run ESLint checks
npm run typecheck # Type checking
```

### Storage & Configuration
- **Local Storage Keys**: `nimble-navigator-characters`, `nimble-navigator-activity-log`, `nimble-navigator-settings`
- **Game Rules**: Centralized in `lib/config/game-config.ts` (dice mechanics, attribute ranges, equipment limits)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas enforce data integrity with configurable limits

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
KEEP THINGS SHORT AND CONCISE - avoid verbose explanations, long commit messages, and unnecessary details.
