# TODOs

## Spell repository

While we currently can learn all spells from a school, it would be great to have a spell browser, similar to the item browser, where I can add spells or abilities to my character explicitly.

## Effects

I want certain things to be able to run one time effects against the character. For example, when a shadowmancer exceeds their power budget, they might take damage. (We probably don't want to do this but the system would be neat.)
